<h2>The elevator pitch</h2>

<p><strong>For</strong> developers.<br>
<strong>who</strong> are newbies or want to learn a new methodology.<br>
<strong>the</strong> Open Weather App.<br>
<strong>is an</strong> easy and complete example.<br>
<strong>that</strong> implements an App that is able to look for the forecast of a selection of cities.<br>
<strong>unlike</strong> the rest of the weather apps that are in the store.<br>
<strong>our</strong> product is open source and can be built, changed and inspected.<br></p>

<h2>NOT list</h2>

<p><strong>IN SCOPE</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Select and deselect cities</li>
<li>Remember selected cities</li>
<li>Perform animations</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>OUT OF SCOPE</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Add new cities</li>
<li>Save forecast</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>UNRESOLVED</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Reorder cities</li>
</ul>


<h2>Meet your neighbours</h2>

<p>Just because in this case we are going to do this project alone, we don&rsquo;t have any neighbour, but this is the perfect situation where you&rsquo;d need to list all that people that is related to the project, near to you or that can do some work in the project that you don&rsquo;t know how to do or is not one of your skills.</p>

<p>I would add here a designer (Don&rsquo;t forget that if you want a good product don&rsquo;t try to design it from your perspective of engineer), a translator if you want multiple localizations, maybe an accountant if there is some kind of financial calculations that your app have to do, etc &hellip;</p>

<p>Here is the place to list all that people, with their contact data, their skills and, if you think is appropriated, their fares.</p>

<p>In this group you could also add those meant to be recipients of the <em>App</em> as, in other situations they probably would like to say some words about the proposal, the design and the time estimations.</p>

<h2>Show the solution</h2>

<p>Because of the simplicity of this project, there is not many documents we need to create before starting, so I decided to add a general schema, and screens mockups.</p>

<table>
 <tr>

 </tr>

 </tr>
</table>


<p>Screen flow schema</p>

<h2>Ask what keep us up at night</h2>

<ul>
<li>Changes in the service we decide to use to get the forecast.</li>
<li>Excess of API calls that may collapse the service as it is a free service.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Size it up</h2>

<p>As we have a project that is going to be published through a blog and a podcast, we are being a little tricky here as we are taking more time than what it should take.</p>

<ul>
<li>1st Delivery: Inception Deck</li>
<li>2nd Delivery: Develop the model</li>
<li>3rd Delivery: Develop the views</li>
<li>4th Delivery: Develop the controller</li>
<li>5th Delivery: Develop the animations</li>
<li>6th Delivery: Build and upload to App Store</li>
</ul>
